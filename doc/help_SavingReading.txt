LOADING AND SAVING DATA
=======================

It is possible to save data that has been imported. This is done from the 'Data' tab.

The following formats are supported:
    CSV         Comma Seperated Values [default]
    MAT         MATLAB data file

Data that has been processed and saved as one of these formats can also be loaded directly. 

The 'Data' tab also serves as a basic data review platform.
