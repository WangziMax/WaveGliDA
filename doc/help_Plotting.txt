PLOTTING MAPS AND DATA
======================

Two types of figures can be plotted: Time Series and Scatter Maps


Time Series
-----------
Go to the 'Time Series' tab. Choose the appropriate X-axis variable:
    Date Time       (pandas.DataFrame.index)
    Latitude
    Longitude
    
There is the option to choose one or two Y-axes. For each of the axes you can set the following:
    Axis Title      [alpha-numeric]
    Min - Max       [numeric / datetime]
    line params     line color
                    line style
                    line width
    marker params   marker face color
                    marker shape
                    marker size
    
Once you've selected your parameters you can plot the figure. The program uses the standard matplotlib backend and a figure should pop up. You can change basic layout in this stage and also save the figure.
